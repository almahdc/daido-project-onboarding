Welcome!
--------

This web-app is imagined to be a flexible on-boarding manufacturers process.

**Stable code** is on branch **maser**.
**Current code** is on branch **develop**.
When adding **new feature** create a branch with a name **feature/name-of-the-feature** and after the code is finished do a merge request for the branch develop.

Minor changes can be done on develop branch.

Front-end is done in React and the back-end is taken care for by AWS Amplify and AWS AppSync with GraphQL.
